# Predicting Loan Repayment for LendingClub

**Overview:**\
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast users' ability to repay loans on time, leveraging historical data from LendingClub. The company, headquartered in San Francisco, California, pioneered peer-to-peer lending and is recognized for registering its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with introducing loan trading on a secondary market.

**Key Steps:**
1) Data Preparation: Load and clean historical data, ensuring it's suitable for analysis.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into data distribution, correlations, and patterns.
3) Model Training: Split data into training and testing sets; train Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
4) Parameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to enhance performance.
5) Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using testing data; calculate accuracy scores.
6) Handling Overfitting and Underfitting: Apply techniques to address these issues and ensure model generalization.

**Results:**
 * Decision Tree and Random Forest models demonstrated the highest accuracy scores and effective prediction capabilities.
 * The models offer valuable insights for LendingClub, aiding in creditworthiness assessment and informed lending decisions.

**Next Steps:**
 * Continuously monitor and update models with new data.
 * Explore additional features and algorithms to further improve prediction accuracy and robustness.

This concise summary encapsulates the essence of the machine learning project, outlining its objectives, methodology, outcomes, and future directions.
